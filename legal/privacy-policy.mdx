## Introduction

At NoteMate, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our services. We believe in transparency and want you to understand how we handle your data throughout your experience with our platform.

## Information We Collect

We may collect several types of information from and about users of our services to provide a seamless and personalised experience. This information includes:

**Personal Information:** We collect personal identifiers such as your name and email address when registering for our services. This information helps us create and maintain your account, authenticate your identity, and provide personalised features.

**Usage Data:** We gather information about how you interact with our services, including which features you use most frequently, the pages you visit, and the actions you take within our platform. This helps us understand how our services are being used and identify areas for improvement.

**Device Information:** We collect technical data about the device you use to access our services, including hardware model, operating system version, browser type, and other device characteristics. This information helps us optimise our services for different devices and troubleshoot technical issues.

**Cookies and Similar Technologies:** We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our platform. These technologies help us remember your preferences, understand how you use our services, and improve functionality.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes designed to improve your experience and maintain the quality of our services:

- We provide and maintain our services by using your information to create and manage your account, process transactions, and ensure the technical functionality of our platform. Your data helps us deliver the features you expect and rely on.

- We notify you about important changes to our services, such as updates to features, terms, or policies that might affect your experience. This ensures you always have the latest information about how our services work.

- We enable your participation in interactive features by using your preferences and usage patterns to customise your experience. This allows you to get the most value from our platform's capabilities.

- We provide responsive customer support by using your account information and communication history to address your questions and resolve issues efficiently. This helps us deliver timely and relevant assistance when you need it.

- We gather valuable analytical insights that help us improve our services by identifying usage patterns, understanding feature adoption, and recognising areas that need enhancement. This continuous improvement process makes our platform better for everyone.

- We monitor usage patterns to ensure system stability, optimise performance, and maintain service quality. This technical monitoring helps us deliver a reliable experience.

- We detect, prevent, and address technical issues by analysing error reports, usage anomalies, and system performance data. This proactive approach helps us resolve problems quickly and maintain service reliability.

## Data Security

We have implemented appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorised way. Our comprehensive security program includes technical safeguards, access controls, and security assessments.

We limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a legitimate business need. All personnel with access to user data are bound by confidentiality obligations.

Our security practices are regularly reviewed and updated to address new threats and vulnerabilities. We employ industry-standard encryption, secure development practices, and robust authentication mechanisms to protect your information.

## Data Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it. This includes satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements that apply to our business.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process the data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

When your data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, we will securely delete or anonymise it so that it can no longer be associated with you. In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice.

## Your Data Protection Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. We respect these rights and have processes in place to help you exercise them:

**The right to access your information:** You can request copies of your personal data that we hold. This allows you to know what information we have and verify that we're processing it lawfully.

**The right to update or delete your information:** You can request that we correct inaccurate data or complete incomplete data that we hold about you. In certain circumstances, you can also ask us to delete your personal data.

**The right to object:** You can object to our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when we're relying on a legitimate interest basis for processing.

**The right of restriction:** You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when you're contesting the accuracy of your data.

**The right to data portability:** You can request that we provide you or a third party with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

**The right to withdraw consent:** If we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Us" section below. We will respond to all legitimate requests within the timeframes required by applicable law.

## Third-Party Services

Our services may contain links to third-party websites and services that are not owned or controlled by NoteMate. These links are provided for your convenience and information, but they operate under their own privacy policies.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit and service you use.

When you use third-party integrations within our service, such as authentication providers or payment processors, your interaction with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies in addition to ours. We carefully select our third-party service providers and require them to respect your privacy, but we encourage you to familiarise yourself with their practices.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not intended for use by people under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian, and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. We recognise the importance of protecting children's privacy, and comply with applicable laws designed for this purpose.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

For significant changes that materially alter your privacy rights, we will provide more prominent notice, such as sending you an email notification or displaying a banner within our services. This ensures you're aware of important changes that might affect how your information is handled.

We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Your continued use of our services after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
