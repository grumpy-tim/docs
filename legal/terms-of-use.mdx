# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how NoteMate ("**NoteMate**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our clinical documentation platform ("**Service**").

## 1. Zero-Knowledge Architecture

### 1.1 Core Principles

Our software architecture ensures that your privacy and data security are paramount. The application is designed so that it cannot access or decrypt your sensitive clinical content. All clinical documentation is stored locally on your device, which means we cannot access, view, or retrieve your clinical content under any circumstances. You maintain complete control over your sensitive information. Content is temporarily transmitted for processing purposes such as transcription and generation, after which it is immediately and permanently deleted from our systems.

### 1.2 Data Categories

We handle different types of data with specific protections tailored to each category:

**Content Data (Local Storage):** This includes all clinical documentation stored on your device, generated transcripts and documents, audio recordings before processing, and any generated clinical content. This data remains on your local device and is not accessible to us.

**Operational Data (Minimal Storage):** This encompasses authentication data managed by Clerk, usage metrics and quotas, payment information processed via Stripe, application monitoring data, and template storage and management. We collect what is necessary to provide and maintain the service.

**Processing Data (Temporary):** This includes audio recordings during transcription, text during document generation, and other content that is transmitted securely for processing. This data is immediately discarded after processing is complete and is never stored permanently.

## 2. Data Processing and Partners

### 2.1 Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services with strict data processing agreements to ensure your data remains protected:

**OpenAI (United States):** OpenAI provides audio transcription services using their Whisper technology. They handle temporary audio transcription with no data retention and no training or model fine-tuning using your data.
