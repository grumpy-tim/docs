### 1.1 Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Our compliance is built on a zero-knowledge architecture where:

1. The application cannot access or decrypt your sensitive clinical content
    
2. Clinical documentation is stored locally on your device
    
3. Content is temporarily transmitted for processing (transcription and generation)
    
4. We maintain only essential operational data and templates
