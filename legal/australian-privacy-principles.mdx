# Australian Privacy Principles

This document outlines how NoteMate ("**NoteMate**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") complies with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988.

## 1. Data Architecture Foundation

### 1.1 Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Our compliance is built on a zero-knowledge architecture where the application cannot access or decrypt your sensitive clinical content. All clinical documentation is stored locally on your device, ensuring that your data remains under your control. Content is temporarily transmitted for processing purposes such as transcription and generation, after which it is immediately deleted. We maintain essential operational data and templates necessary for the service to function.

### 1.2 Data Categories

We handle three distinct categories of data with different protection mechanisms:

**Authentication Data:** This includes user authentication data, security settings, account management information, and multi-factor authentication settings. This data is necessary to verify your identity and secure your account.

**Operational Data:** This encompasses usage limits and quotas, rate limiting data, application metrics, and template storage and management. This information helps us maintain service quality and ensure fair usage.

**Processing Data:** This includes audio recordings for transcription, text for document generation, and other content that is transmitted securely and immediately discarded after processing. We do not retain this data beyond the time needed for processing.

## 2. APP Compliance Details

### 2.1 APP 1: Open and Transparent Management

We demonstrate transparency through comprehensive documentation and robust management practices. Our documentation includes clear privacy policies, detailed data handling information, regular policy updates, and accessible privacy information. Our management practices encompass documented procedures, clear accountability structures, and incident response planning to ensure we maintain the highest standards of privacy protection.

### 2.2 APP 2: Anonymity and Pseudonymity

We support privacy by minimising data collection and providing user control over personal information. We collect essential operational data and avoid unnecessary personal information collection. We do not store clinical content on our servers. Users maintain control through local data storage, user-managed profiles, and optional feature usage that allows you to decide what functionality to use.

### 2.3 APP 3: Collection of Solicited Information

We maintain minimal collection practices for the different types of data we handle. Authentication data is managed by Clerk and includes essential credentials, security settings, and account management information. Operational data covers usage metrics, system performance information, security monitoring, and template storage, but never includes clinical content. Billing data is managed by Stripe, and encompasses payment information, subscription details, and transaction history.

### 2.4 APP 4: Dealing with Unsolicited Information

Our architecture prevents unsolicited information through technical measures and operational procedures. Technical measures include our zero-knowledge design, immediate processing deletion policies, absence of content storage, and local clinical data approach. Our operational procedures establish clear data boundaries and processing limitations to ensure compliance.

### 2.5 APP 5: Notification of Collection

We provide clear notification about data handling and purpose information. Our data handling notifications cover the types of information processed, processing methods, third-party services involved, and processing duration. Purpose information explains the intended use of data, processing necessity, service functionality, and user benefits to ensure you understand why certain information is collected.

### 2.6 APP 6: Use or Disclosure

Our data handling ensures limited use and controlled disclosure of your information. We use data for specified purposes with no secondary use, marketing use, or data sharing beyond what is necessary for service provision. Disclosure is limited to processing partners only, under strict agreements, for limited duration, with immediate deletion after processing is complete.

### 2.7 APP 7: Direct Marketing

We maintain privacy by avoiding marketing use of your data and implementing communication limits. We do not use personal information for marketing purposes, track behaviour, or build user profiles. Our communications are limited to service updates, security notifications, essential information, and respect user-controlled preferences.

### 2.8 APP 8: Cross-border Disclosure

We manage international processing through partner services and technical controls. Our partner services include AI, database storage, authentication, and payment processing. Technical controls include encrypted transmission, immediate processing deletion, no persistent storage of clinical data, and template storage in Australian data centres.

### 2.9 APP 9: Government Identifiers

We ensure compliance by implementing data limitations and a secure authentication approach. Our data limitations mean we do not collect or store government identifiers, Medicare numbers, tax identifiers, or health identifiers. Our authentication approach uses email-based identification, secure credentials, professional verification when necessary, and does not require government ID.

### 2.10 APP 10: Quality of Personal Information

We maintain data quality through real-time processing and quality controls. Real-time processing means no historical storage, immediate updates, regular verification, and user control over information. Quality controls include accuracy checks, validation procedures, update mechanisms, and error correction processes.

### 2.11 APP 11: Security of Personal Information

Our security measures include technical controls and operational security practices. Technical controls encompass encryption for all data in-transit, zero-knowledge architecture, multi-factor authentication, and access controls. Operational security includes incident response procedures and security monitoring.

### 2.12 APP 12: Access to Personal Information

We provide access through account management tools and various access methods. Account management includes profile settings via Clerk, subscription management, usage statistics, and template management. Access methods include a self-service account dashboard and support assistance when needed.

### 2.13 APP 13: Correction of Personal Information

We enable corrections through account updates and data accuracy measures. Account updates allow for email address changes, profile information updates, and subscription modifications. Data accuracy is maintained through immediate profile updates, template management, and usage tracking verification.

## 3. Mental Health Practice Requirements

### 3.1 Clinical Use

When using NoteMate in mental health practice, there are specific consent requirements and professional obligations to consider. Consent requirements include obtaining explicit client/patient consent, documented approval, clear information about data handling, and withdrawal options. Professional obligations encompass clinical standards relevant to your profession, privacy compliance, record keeping, and security measures. NoteMate is designed for use by all qualified mental health professionals, including but not limited to psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, social workers, and other qualified practitioners.
